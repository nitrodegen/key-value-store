Key value pair:



basic table;


-----------
  KEY    |
         |
----------
         |
  VALUE  |
----------

so it doesnt matter what it is in object
you can make value whatever you want
key will store just name 
value will store struct that user provided and size of every element

***commands:***
SELECT * 
will return all of the keys and values in this database
----
insert <key> <value>
will make a new entry with key and value 
server side stuff:
  server will add this to file, and reload db
